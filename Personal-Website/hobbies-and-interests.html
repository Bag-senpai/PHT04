        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The gaming side of mine also started in my childhood because I got myself exposed to devices real fast--both keypad cellphones and desktop computers.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;For keypad phones, at first I got exposed to the classic Snake game, then from that time, I frankly got my addicted lol and went on to explore the games of other devices. Yes--literally other keypad phones. Whenever I see a phone of someone else, I'd grab it and play a game on. Whenever the keypad phone had a PIN on it though, I'd pout and sulk while looking for other opportunities XD. Due to that experience though, I got exposed to numerous games you can find in different keypad phones. I'll link each of them <a href = "games-played.html">here</a> for nostalgic vibes~ Canal Control, Bounce, Bounce Tales, Golf, Soccer League, Miki's World, Diamond Rush, Assassin's Creed, Mancala, Treasure Towers, Disco, Deep Abyss, City Bloxx, Snowboard 3D, Pocket Carrom.
