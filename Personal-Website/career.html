        <h3>How I Got Into Coding</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The story goes back in elementary when I noticed that I always aced my exams in computer subjects back then. I knew the basic parts of a computer and each of their functions as well. I also knew how to utilize Microsoft Office apps including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I got that "Best in Computer Science" award back when I graduated there.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;On my 7th grade in high school, it was apparently just the same Microsoft Office apps we discussed, although we then started discussing the number systems used in computing (Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal), along with the ASCII code of characters. The realization of my prowess in coding only happened in my 8th grade when more technical aspects of computers were discussed. There were absolute value representatons, sign bits, 1's and 2's, and float representations. Flowcharts were also introduced at the time. It was also that time when we finally began to start--coding. The programming language we used was C++, although we also got into creating makeshift code at code.org.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;It began to pique my interest as I also created programs for aid in my learning like creating programs of quizzes for reviewing, as well as trivial matters like guess my number and stuff. It then continued up until college, and until now, although college wasn't an easy feat for sure.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;As of now, I'm aiming for a startup job that has a direct connection with computer science. My dream job is to become a game developer someday. <a href = "#">Click here</a> to read my story in the gaming side!</p>
