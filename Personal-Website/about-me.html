        <h3>[May 2024] Who was your favorite teacher and why?</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'll answer them in four answers for each educational level. In pre-elementary of course I had the one and only Ma'am Fe Garcia because she was really caring for the whole class and I got to be her teacher too when I was in 3rd grade.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;For elementary, other than Ma'am Fe Garcia, I liked Sir Bryan Macalma for his discipline and virtues in life. He admired my honesty when I've done some trivial things in school. I've ran inside the computer lab in a weekend and I played some games there. When it came to that time when authorities were questioning about the event, I eventually admitted it to him with hesitation and I felt comforted when he told me I did a good thing for my honesty that time.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;On to high school, of course it's lowkey biased due to my favorite subject (which is Computer Science) but I liked Sir <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarence-ordonia-804553208/" target = "_blank">Clarence Ordonia</a> all throughout my high school life. He was incredibly friendly and accomodating to all students. Of course he knows to reprimand when students cross the line but otherwise, he keeps a happy and inspired face.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In college, I met our batch adviser Ma'am <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashlyn-kim-balangcod-0b50b038/" target="_blank">Ashlyn Kim Balangcod</a>. She's a dearing and a friendly teacher. Her calm tone reassures comfort to all of her students at heart. When we talk to her, we can't help but smile too in return. I know I can't really say much but trust me, once you meet her you'll understand what I mean. üòÅ</p>
